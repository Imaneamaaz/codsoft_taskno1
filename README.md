# codsoft_taskno1
This project implements a text classification model for a chatbot using PyTorch and NLTK. The primary goal is to develop a chatbot that can understand and categorize user inputs based on predefined intents. The model employs a neural network for intent classification and a bag-of-words approach for feature extraction.
# Chatbot 

## Description
This repository contains code for training a text classification model using PyTorch to create a chatbot. The model is designed to understand and classify user inputs based on predefined intents and patterns. It uses a bag-of-words approach for feature extraction and a neural network for classification.

## Features
- Text tokenization and stemming
- Bag-of-words representation
- Neural network model for classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Save and load trained model
- Interactive chatbot interface

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `torchaudio`
- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `json`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio nltk numpy
